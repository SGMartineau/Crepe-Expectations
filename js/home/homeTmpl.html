    <h3>Crepe Expectations</h3>
    <p>We are a crepe only catering company. We work hard to make sure our crepes are always amazing and that our service is top notch.  We were created to be an affordable yet amazing option for wedding receptions, but we work well in any environment where there are people who want to eat delicious crepes.</p>
    <h5>Our Product</h5>
    <p>We set up our crepe cooking station and cook up fresh, ready-to-eat crepes on the spot.  Our toppings are set up on a nearby table in beautiful glass containers where you build your own crepe. Our toppings (<a ng-href='#/product'>toppings list here</a>) are fresh, made the day of the event, and flavored to perfection.  We also provide a water station free of charge and for slightly more can also set up a lemmonade station.</p>
    <h5>Experience</h5>
    <p>The two main chefs have cooked well over half a million crepes at all sorts of events.  They are quick and efficient.  Each crepe get flamed on the spot and provides fun entertainment for those in a short, quick-moving line while waiting for their own crepe.</p>
